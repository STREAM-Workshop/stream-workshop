    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The STREAM Workshop (Systematic Trust in AI Models: Ensuring Fairness, Reliability, Explainability, and Accountability in Machine Learning Frameworks) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of systems design and trustworthy artificial intelligence. As AI continues to influence critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and mobility, there is a pressing need to examine how trustworthiness is embedded not just in models, but across the entire pipelineâ€”spanning data collection, architecture design, training workflows, deployment, and evaluation.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        STREAM focuses on system-level approaches to ensure fairness, robustness, explainability, accountability, and privacy in computer vision systems and beyond. This workshop invites contributions that offer practical, theoretical, and interdisciplinary perspectives on building trustworthy AI at scale. By convening experts from academia, industry, and policy, STREAM fosters dialogue and innovation around concrete mechanisms that make AI more reliable and responsible in real-world applications.
