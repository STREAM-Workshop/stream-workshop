    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>

    <p>We invite submissions of original research, position papers, and visionary work that address systems-level trustworthiness in AI, particularly within the domain of computer vision. The STREAM workshop welcomes contributions from academia, industry, and policy sectors that propose innovative frameworks, techniques, or empirical studies aligned with the workshopâ€™s themes.</p>
    
    <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
    
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>System-Level Fairness:</b> Designing ML frameworks and pipelines that promote fairness from the ground up</li>
        <li><b>Robust and Reliable Architectures:</b> Developing AI systems resilient to edge cases, adversarial inputs, and distributional shifts</li>
        <li><b>Explainability by Design:</b> Creating architectures that enable intuitive, actionable explanations for model decisions</li>
        <li><b>Accountability Mechanisms:</b> Building systems that support traceability, error analysis, and responsible deployment</li>
        <li><b>Bias Mitigation Pipelines:</b> Integrating bias detection and correction into the system architecture and training process</li>
        <li><b>Privacy-Preserving System Designs:</b> Leveraging techniques such as differential privacy, federated learning, and secure computation</li>
        <li><b>Scalability and Generalization:</b> Ensuring trustworthy AI performance across distributed, real-time, and cloud-based environments</li>
        <li><b>Evaluation and Benchmarking:</b> Proposing standards and metrics for system-level trustworthiness in AI</li>
        <li><b>Interdisciplinary Perspectives:</b> Contributions at the intersection of AI systems, law, ethics, and social sciences</li>
        <li><b>Deployment and Real-World Case Studies:</b> Lessons learned from deploying trustworthy AI in critical domains like healthcare, mobility, and finance</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>STREAM especially encourages submissions that include concrete implementations, prototypes, or case studies demonstrating how system-level trust considerations translate into practice.</p>
    
    <h2>Important Dates</h2>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Call for Papers Released: May 4, 2025</li>
            <li>Paper Submission Deadline: August 20, 2025</li>
            <li>Author Notifications: July 11, 2025</li>
            <li>Camera-Ready Deadline: July 21, 2025</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        
    <h2>Important Dates</h2>

    <p>Submitted papers must adhere to the ICCV 2025 formatting guidelines and should not exceed eight pages, including figures and tables. Additional pages may be used for references only, and these will not count toward the page limit. However, any appendices included as part of the main paper must fall within the eight-page limit. Authors who wish to include additional material beyond the main paper are encouraged to submit supplementary material as a single compressed .zip file, with a maximum size of 50MB. The deadline for submitting supplementary material is the same as the main paper submission deadline.</p>
    
    <p>All submissions must be properly anonymized to comply with the double-blind review process. Papers that are not anonymized, do not follow the ICCV 2025 style template, or exceed the eight-page limit (excluding references) may be rejected without review. Accepted papers will be published as part of the official ICCV 2025 Workshop Proceedings.</p>
